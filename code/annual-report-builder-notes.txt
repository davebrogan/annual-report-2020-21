Annual Report Builder - Notes

There is a Annual Report Template flowchart pdf in local file that shows process for global, project-level and page-level stylesheets.

There is a page build to provide asset creation guidance to designers and other content providers.

There should be a page demonstrating the different UI elements and maybe even put the code there. Or build the style-guide in Google Docs.

Copy the codebase each year for each build. The codebase is production only. I don't think there is a dev version.
