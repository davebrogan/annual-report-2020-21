                <div class="text-box__text">
                    <p>Weber State football built on its successful 2017 campaign, repeating as Big Sky Conference champions in 2018 en route to another FCS quarterfinals appearance. The Wildcats finished the season ranked No. 6 in the country in the STATS FCS poll, winning 10 or more games in back-to-back years for the first time in school history. WSU entered the playoffs as the No. 2 overall seed, also a program best.</p>

                    <p>Individually, the Wildcats had a school record 13 players named to the Big Sky All-Conference first team, seven of whom also earned All-America honors. Leading the way was freshman running back <strong>Josh Davis</strong>, who set a WSU freshman record with 1,362 rushing yards and 10 total touchdowns. His efforts earned him the Jerry Rice Award as the National Freshman of the Year. He was also named Utah Male Collegiate Athlete of the Year at Utah Gov. Gary Herbert&rsquo;s State of Sports Awards. As the Wildcats attempt a three-peat in 2019, they will do so with a new look to their home field. In September, Weber State broke ground on a 27,000-square-foot athletics complex in Stewart Stadium&rsquo;s north end zone. The new building will include the Barbara and Rory Youngberg Football Center, the Sark&rsquo;s Boys Gateway, the Stromberg Strength and Conditioning Complex, the Marquardt-Kimball Plaza and the Behnken Plaza. The project opened in advance of the 2019 home-opener.</p>

            <h2 class="regular-article__title">Creating a Family Home Built for Efficiency</h2>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>Weber State students were honored with first place for energy performance, second place for presentation, and third place for engineering in the international Solar Decathlon Build Challenge sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>

                <p>In the challenge, student teams designed and built high-performance, low-carbon-producing homes powered by renewables. More than 100 teams, including those from Yale and Harvard, submitted detailed design proposals. From those, nine international teams were selected to build.</p>

                <p>For the decathlon, 50+ Weber State and Davis and Ogden-Weber Technical College students, under the direction of Building Design &amp; Construction professor Jeremy Farner, contributed to construct a net-zero home in central Ogden.</p>

                <p>Wildcat alumni Melissa and Mark Haslam, who bought the home, are now enjoying energy costs of just over $100 annually or around $9 per month to connect to the electrical grid.</p>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>The College of Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, in partnership with WSU&rsquo;s Division of Online &amp; Continuing Education, held a series of virtual community courses, exploring relevant world issues with about 100 or more registered participants in each course.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;We offered these courses because we wanted to enrich our own &mdash; and our students&rsquo; &mdash; understanding of the issues shaping our lives,&rdquo; said Susan Matt, history professor.</p>

                <p>The first course, &ldquo;Pandemics and People,&rdquo; offered an overview of the effects of a global pandemic. Other courses examined polarization around the country, as well as the history of the civil rights movement and the continued fight for racial equality.</p>

                <p>The college plans to unveil a new set of hot topics in fall 2021.</p>
