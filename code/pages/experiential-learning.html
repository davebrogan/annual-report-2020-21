                <p class="text-box__subtitle">WSU Unveils Virtual Innovations Amid Pandemic</p>

                <div class="text-box__text">
                    <p>Despite the challenges of the 2020&ndash;21 academic year, Weber State found innovative ways to continue prioritizing student success.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;Our students, faculty and staff truly unleashed their creative potential,&rdquo; said <strong>President Brad Mortensen</strong>. &ldquo;They faced all pandemic challenges with grit and determination, effectively expanding the history of innovation at Weber State.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The College of Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences formed a COVID-19 outreach team, dubbed &ldquo;Team Awesome,&rdquo; to keep student workers employed. The group contacted all 2,100 CSBS students and faculty to ensure they were doing well and had the necessary resources to continue succeeding in their courses.&nbsp;<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
                        Seniors in the automotive program, housed in the College of Engineering, Applied Science &amp; Technology, completed their capstone projects remotely. They developed new technology, such as a device to aid automotive technicians in identifying common vehicular problems.</p>

                    <p>Student Services held many events virtually, including the annual Career Fair and the Student Services Expo. Counseling &amp; Psychological Services also offered new virtual options, including a Mindful Meditation Group for faculty and staff.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Other areas used hybrid methods to reach students, such as tutoring services, which hosted 3,578 face-to-face sessions and 5,034 virtual sessions.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The College of Science created 3D geological field trips to the Discovery Loop, Antelope Island and Spiral Jetty. The telescopes on the roof of Tracy Hall were utilized for virtual astronomy courses and community star parties. A virtual Mars landing watch party was also held, allowing students to learn about the physics behind the landing, and 1,000 hands-on micrometeorite kits were given to local schools. The Science in the Parks program handed out 15,000 science kits over summer to local students, too.</p>

                    <p>The Goddard School of Business &amp; Economics used the opportunity of working remotely to officially launch their online MBA program, as well as an online entrepreneurship minor, both 100% virtual. They also held Zoom Career Bites, which hosted a different industry professional each week to provide support for those searching for work.</p>

                    <p>The Department of Performing Arts hosted 79 virtual events throughout the year, attracting more than 60,000 viewers. Events included digital theatre experiences, Orchesis Dance Theatre and dozens of music recitals streamed via Facebook. The Shaw Gallery utilized 3D technology to offer tours, allowing the community to view exhibitions from home.</p>

                    <p>The WSU Storytelling Festival was held online, celebrating 25 years of storytelling with 25 days of stories. Throughout the festival, new links were posted on the festival website that took users to recorded stories. While storytellers were not able to visit schools this year, the program still brought the magic of storytelling to students around the state.</p>

                    <p>In addition to virtual demonstrations, students in health professions worked with state-of-the-art technology that enhanced their clinical simulation experience. The new technology included the Butterfly IQ probes used in the School of Radiologic Sciences, which offer increased accessibility and decreased cleaning demands, allowing students to identify human anatomy, including the vascular system.</p>

                    <p>Many of the innovations from the past year will be carried into future semesters to continue enhancing student learning experiences and innovating at WSU.</p>

            <h2 class="regular-article__title">Creating a Family Home Built for Efficiency</h2>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>Weber State students were honored with first place for energy performance, second place for presentation, and third place for engineering in the international Solar Decathlon Build Challenge sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>

                <p>In the challenge, student teams designed and built high-performance, low-carbon-producing homes powered by renewables. More than 100 teams, including those from Yale and Harvard, submitted detailed design proposals. From those, nine international teams were selected to build.</p>

                <p>For the decathlon, 50+ Weber State and Davis and Ogden-Weber Technical College students, under the direction of Building Design &amp; Construction professor <strong>Jeremy Farner</strong>, contributed to construct a net-zero home in central Ogden.</p>

                <p>Wildcat alumni <strong>Melissa</strong> and <strong>Mark Haslam</strong>, who bought the home, are now enjoying energy costs of just over $100 annually or around $9 per month to connect to the electrical grid.</p>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>The College of Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, in partnership with WSU&rsquo;s Division of Online &amp; Continuing Education, held a series of virtual community courses, exploring relevant world issues with about 100 or more registered participants in each course.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;We offered these courses because we wanted to enrich our own &mdash; and our students&rsquo; &mdash; understanding of the issues shaping our lives,&rdquo; said <strong>Susan Matt</strong>, history professor.</p>

                <p>The first course, &ldquo;Pandemics and People,&rdquo; offered an overview of the effects of a global pandemic. Other courses examined polarization around the country, as well as the history of the civil rights movement and the continued fight for racial equality.</p>

                <p>The college plans to unveil a new set of hot topics in fall 2021.</p>
