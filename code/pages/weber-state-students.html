            <h2 class="regular-article__title"><span class="ar-block-text--headline">April Callister found her passion and became a renowned expert in it</span></h2>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>The title of spring 2021 graduate <strong>April Callister&rsquo;s</strong> 15-page academic manuscript is impressive: <i>Effect of Indigenous Diet Iron Content and Location on Hemoglobin Levels of Ghanaians.</i> Equally impressive, as an undergraduate studying sports nutrition education, she had her manuscript published in the journal <i>Nutrients Quartile 1</i>, a big deal in science and nutrition fields. Perhaps even more impressive are the invitations Callister received to present her work at some of the world&rsquo;s largest gatherings of food and nutrition experts, including <i>The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&rsquo; 2020 Food and Nutrition Conference and Expo</i>, and The American Society for Nutrition&rsquo;s annual flagship meeting, <i>Nutrition 2021</i>. But what&rsquo;s <em>truly</em> astounding, is that Callister volunteered to write the research paper; it wasn&rsquo;t a class assignment.</p>

                <p>Previously, she had partnered on a required project with <strong>David Aguilar-Alvarez</strong>, assistant professor of nutrition. Later, he asked if she&rsquo;d be interested in a second collaboration. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Hey, I think this would be an opportunity; it would give you a lot of great experience,&rsquo;&rdquo; Callister recalled. &ldquo;So, I was able to work on the project with a group of professors who thought I was up to the task.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Callister&rsquo;s research involved analyzing data previously collected by Weber State professors who traveled to Ghana to record food consumed by people in five different Ghanaian cities. The researchers also drew blood samples. Once Callister&rsquo;s team analyzed the data, they found that the people who ate more iron-rich foods had higher hemoglobin levels, which meant they were less likely to suffer from iron-deficiency anemia. The goal was to find community-specific solutions to the widespread problem of the condition. &ldquo;Because something that may work in Ogden, Utah, probably isn&rsquo;t going to work in Ghana,&rdquo; Callister said.</p>

                <p>Given her passion for her topic and her exciting opportunities to discuss it with global audiences, you can only imagine her disappointment when every conference she planned to attend was moved to an online format because of the pandemic.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;I was kind of bummed,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s lower engagement when it&rsquo;s online, but the fact that I was accepted alongside these bigger researchers was pretty crazy.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Callister&rsquo;s next educational adventure awaits at the University of Costa Rica, where she will pursue a master&rsquo;s degree in clinical nutrition of noncommunicable diseases. Then, hopefully, it&rsquo;s on to a physician&rsquo;s assistant program. &ldquo;My hope is to use the understanding of nutrition and medicine to improve healthcare wherever I&rsquo;m living,&rdquo; she said. Wherever that is, Callister will remember WSU&rsquo;s nutrition program and Aguilar-Alvarez. &ldquo;I would have had no idea how to be able to do this or even that it was a possibility had he not approached me,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                <p>Callister&rsquo;s story is an inspiring example of what makes Weber State so great, Great, GREAT &mdash; professors who know how to challenge their students and care enough to do it; and students who are willing to go the extra mile to enrich their college experience. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve actually gone to three different universities and the opportunities and mentorship I&rsquo;ve had at Weber State are not available everywhere,&rdquo; she maintains. &ldquo;They are so incredibly unique to Weber.&rdquo;</p>

            <h2 class="regular-article__title">From Intern to L3Harris Leader</h2>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p><strong>Emily Nelson BS &rsquo;14</strong> said finishing her degree at Weber State while holding an internship at L3Harris Technologies was tough but she was determined to succeed.&nbsp;<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    Now the software lead of a $500 million program at the Salt Lake City company, her determination paid off. Smith is in charge of the software that controls hardware for some of the U.S. Department of Defense&rsquo;s electronic warfare activities.&nbsp;<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    WSU knew how to challenge her, and cared enough to do it.&nbsp;<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    Smith, the mother of two now teenage sons, enrolled at WSU in part because it was affordable, but she also really liked the computer science program.<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    &ldquo;The professors are really great there, they&rsquo;re really one-on-one,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The classes were small so you get that attention you need to actually excel.&rdquo;<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    John Hirschi, Smith&rsquo;s manager at L3Harris and fellow WSU alum, praises her for leading the software effort for the largest program their company has ever been awarded.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;She gets results,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a respected leader and gets the job done.&rdquo;<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    Smith also received the National Women in Aerospace Award in 2020.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be recognized for your sacrifice, and if something like that can inspire other women to go into aerospace that&rsquo;s even better,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                <p>WSU computer science department chair Kyle Feuz said his department encourages under-represented groups to enroll in the program through K-12 outreach efforts and ensuring students don&rsquo;t feel alone or isolated.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Our enrollment numbers aren&#39;t going to change overnight but we&#39;ve seen a steady increase in our female student population over the last several years and that is a trend we hope to continue,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I love seeing Emily and students like her go on to be successful and that success is what will ultimately drive progress forward.&rdquo;<br />

            <h2 class="regular-article__title-with-sub">Physics Down to a Fine Art</h2>

            <p class="regular-article__subtitle">Student Rachell Lemmons discovered and thrived in physics at WSU.</p>

            <div>
                <p dir="ltr"><strong>Rachell Lemmons BS &rsquo;21</strong> loves a challenge.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">In fact, she loves a challenge so much she switched her major from art to physics after two years of working toward her degree. Starting at Weber State in 2014 as an art teaching major, she had an &ldquo;aha moment&rdquo; after taking an astronomy class from professor Stacy Palen.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">In support of her new major, Lemmons volunteered and then was later hired at Ott Planetarium where she worked with Palen, and then after with physics professor John Armstrong.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The difference between physics and art isn&rsquo;t as much as you&rsquo;d think,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think it takes the same sense of exploration and the same sense of creativity, and it&rsquo;s obvious she has an eye for composition and an eye for different artistic things.&rdquo;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">At the planetarium, Lemmons created an educational short film about terraforming Mars, <a href="https://vimeo.com/537793914">&ldquo;The Martian Initiative.&rdquo;</a> The movie started out as a simple outreach project but evolved into a much bigger endeavor. She partnered with actors, video technicians, asked NASA for permission to use graphics, designed costumes and even won a grant to fund her efforts. Lemmons and her film crew shot footage in Moab shortly before COVID-19 hit the United States. Armstrong said while it would have been completely understandable for Lemmons to take a break or let the pandemic derail her project, she &ldquo;really went above and beyond.&rdquo;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">On top of all her Weber State endeavors &mdash; along with running an online jewelry-making business and raising her young daughter Rubee &mdash; Lemmons worked at Northrop Grumman. She has held several positions there over the years that have allowed her to work in areas including nuclear hardness and survivability as well as systems engineering for ground-based strategic deterrents, more commonly known as missiles.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;It is challenging, it really is, and I get excited for that challenge,&rdquo; Lemmons said.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Lemmons has used her position to help other Weber State students find internships and other opportunities at the company.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;About two years ago, a graduating physics student mentioned he was trying to find a job,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I referred him to the hiring recruiters, and they offered him a position. I was so happy that he got the job! He&#39;s still working at NG too and says he loves it.&rdquo;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Now working fulltime at Northrop Grumman, Lemmons is hopeful to one day pursue a doctorate degree in astrophysics with the aim of working for NASA.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Lemmons&rsquo; daughter, however, appears to be taking a different path. Rubee, who is approaching 7 years old, prefers English and the arts.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;But she&rsquo;ll also ask questions like, &lsquo;Why does the earth turn?&rsquo; and &lsquo;Why does the sun go across the sky?&rsquo; and those questions are really fun to talk about,&rdquo; Lemmons said.</p>

            <h2 class="regular-article__title">Prioritizing Mental Health, Not Just Academic Success</h2>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p><strong>Patrick Luo BS &rsquo;21</strong> remembers working eight- to 12-hour shifts everyday at his family&rsquo;s restaurant in Southern Utah to help them pay the bills and keep their home. Once, he recalls, his parents argued over whether the family would have to skip medical visits for a year to save money.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>With little to spare, college seemed out of the question.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Then, in 2017, he received the full-ride Daniels Scholarship and was accepted to Weber State. He knew he had to make the most of the opportunity. &ldquo;I could not fail,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>That pressure drove him to become an academic success, receiving the Outstanding Student Researcher Award for the Dr. Ezekiel R. Dumke College of Health Professions in 2021. His mental health was another story. &ldquo;When I did fail, I would essentially consider myself worthless, and meaningless,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                <p>Luo found help processing his failures at WSU&rsquo;s Counseling &amp; Psychological Services Center.</p>

                <p>He discovered his coping mechanism had been getting involved in more and more activities to avoid thinking about failure. At WSU, he served as vice president of service for the WSU Student Association and vice president of the Asian Student Involvement Association and was involved in the National Society of Leadership and Success, First Gen Club, The Signpost and other organizations. Logging more than 1,520 volunteer community engagement hours, he received the 2020 Presidential Award for Community-Engaged Student.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>When COVID-19 put a hold on campus activities, his coping mechanism failed.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>&ldquo;I was just super-overwhelmed, and I thought &lsquo;I can&#39;t cope with this,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said.</p>

                <p>It was then he asked for help. &ldquo;I learned why I felt like an absolute failure and deserved to be punished whenever I didn&rsquo;t succeed at one thing or when I received a 99% on a test instead of 100%.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Through therapy, he found ways to accept failure, and he later shared his story through the Presidential Leadership Fellows, an exclusive group of nominated students who go through a highly selective process to serve as Weber State ambassadors while building leadership skills through monthly seminars. &ldquo;If people don&#39;t talk about mental health issues, the stigma and problems behind it are never going to be addressed,&rdquo; Luo said.</p>

                <p>In the fall, he plans to start the Doctor of Physical Therapy program at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. While processing his failures, he will also celebrate his accomplishments.</p>

                    <p>Weber State football built on its successful 2017 campaign, repeating as Big Sky Conference champions in 2018 en route to another FCS quarterfinals appearance. The Wildcats finished the season ranked No. 6 in the country in the STATS FCS poll, winning 10 or more games in back-to-back years for the first time in school history. WSU entered the playoffs as the No. 2 overall seed, also a program best.</p>
                    <p>Individually, the Wildcats had a school record 13 players named to the Big Sky All-Conference first team, seven of whom also earned All-America honors. Leading the way was freshman running back <strong>Josh Davis</strong>, who set a WSU freshman record with 1,362 rushing yards and 10 total touchdowns. His efforts earned him the Jerry Rice Award as the National Freshman of the Year. He was also named Utah Male Collegiate Athlete of the Year at Utah Gov. Gary Herbert&rsquo;s State of Sports Awards. As the Wildcats attempt a three-peat in 2019, they will do so with a new look to their home field. In September, Weber State broke ground on a 27,000-square-foot athletics complex in Stewart Stadium&rsquo;s north end zone. The new building will include the Barbara and Rory Youngberg Football Center, the Sark&rsquo;s Boys Gateway, the Stromberg Strength and Conditioning Complex, the Marquardt-Kimball Plaza and the Behnken Plaza. The project opened in advance of the 2019 home-opener.</p>
