            <div>
                <p>After a successful regular season &mdash; the Wildcats won the Big Sky Conference regular-season softball crown for the fourth straight year &mdash; and a dominating win in the 2019 Big Sky Conference championship game, defeating Northern Colorado 8&ndash;0, the Wildcats earned a trip to the NCAA Tournament in Los Angeles. There, they picked up a 7&ndash;3 win over Cal State Fullerton and became the first team in school and conference history to win an NCAA regional game. The season later ended at the hands of the University of Missouri.</p>

                <p>2019 also saw the Wildcats, led by league MVP <strong>Takesha Saltern</strong>, set a Big Sky win-percentage record with a 14&ndash;2 mark in conference play.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Weber State women&rsquo;s soccer had an incredible turnaround in 2018, earning the Big Sky Conference regular-season championship after a 10th-place finish in 2017, the biggest statistical improvement in conference history. The Wildcats piled up a school-record seven league wins (7&ndash;1&ndash;1 Big Sky, 9&ndash;4&ndash;4 overall) on their way to their first regular-season title since 2008 and their first title of any kind since 2013. With the help of nine All-Big Sky selections, head coach <strong>Tim Crompton</strong> bagged his third Big Sky Coach of the Year honor.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Introduced in 1975, Weber State's emergency healthcare department is one of the oldest of its type
                    in the country. Consequently, it's not uncommon for department chair <strong>William
                        "Bill" Robertson</strong> to run into alumni. However, even he was surprised by a
                    recent connection.</p>

                <p>Robertson was hired to accredit a bachelor&rsquo;s program in emergency medical care in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). At the bottom of a lengthy resume, <strong>Eddie Callachan</strong>, the program director, listed Weber State for his first course as an emergency medical technician. Callachan, who is from South Africa, took an exploratory course at WSU while visiting family in Utah in 1993. &ldquo;It kind of gives you goose bumps to think the things he&rsquo;s doing on the other side of the world started here in this department,&rdquo; Robertson said.</p>

                <p>Callachan earned his Ph.D. in emergency care from the University of Cape Town, and served as chief flight paramedic for critical care transport in the UAE medical services corps.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never forgotten my time at WSU,&rdquo; Callachan wrote.&nbsp;&ldquo;I bet the program must be incredible now.&rdquo;</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Blaine Richards&rsquo; family history included five generations of miners, doing backbreaking work underground and in dangerous conditions. Born in a coal mining camp in Carbon County, Blaine was on track to join them, but, as his granddaughter, WSU Master of Education program director Louise Moulding BS &rsquo;89, MEd &rsquo;95, likes to say, &ldquo;Blaine changed the stars.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Instead of mining, Blaine moved to Ogden and became a sign painter and owner of Richards Sign Co. The move helped usher in a new family legacy at Weber State.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;My father, James Richards, was the first in the family to attend college (at Weber College). His younger brother, Richard Richards, followed,&rdquo; Moulding said. &ldquo;Most of my siblings and their spouses have degrees from WSU. We are a proud Weber State family.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Moulding and her brother, David Richards, pay tribute to their grandfather by ensuring that students who want to change trajectories, like Blaine did, can, through the Blaine B. Richards Scholarship in Art &amp; Design.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>It&rsquo;s one of many scholarships the siblings have created, which also include the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Mary N. Hill Scholarship in Music, in memory of their maternal grandmother</li>
                        <li>The Ralph F. Hill Scholarship in Teacher Education, in memory of their maternal grandfather, who, like Moulding, was a science teacher</li>
                        <li>The Violet G. Richards Scholarship in Interior Design, in memory of their paternal grandmother</li>
                        <li>The Jim and Maurine Richards Scholarship in the Master of Education Program, in honor of their parents</li>
                        <li>Scholarships associated with WSU&rsquo;s Richard Richards Institute for Ethics, named for their uncle, former Weber alumnus, political activist and Republican National Committee chairman.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>&ldquo;My grandfather, Ralph Hill, was sure I&rsquo;d be a principal,&rdquo; Moulding said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to say that didn&rsquo;t happen, because I love being at Weber State.&rdquo;</p>
