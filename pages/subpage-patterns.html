            <p>It was a great year for Weber State hurdler <strong>Tawnie Moore</strong>, who set school and Big Sky Conference records in the 100-meter hurdles, culminating in an 11th-place finish at the NCAA Championships and second-team All-America honors. She is the first hurdler in WSU history &mdash; male or female &mdash; to earn All-America honors in a hurdles event.</p>
            <p>Wildcat senior <strong>Nathan Dunivan</strong> finished 10th in the NCAA discus event with a personal best mark of 189 feet, 5 inches to improve his school record. He also earned second-team All-America honors.</p>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>By creating three large-scale art installations in Ogden, 2018 Hurst Artist-in-Residence Jane Kim connected northern Utah to the Migrating Mural campaign, a nationwide art initiative highlighting endangered animals along migration corridors they share with humans. The Ogden Migrating Murals are part of a larger network of monarch butterfly-inspired murals across the country. Ogden is a pit stop along the monarch&rsquo;s epic 3,000-mile North American migration path.</p>
                <p>The project began at the Ogden Nature Center with six banners depicting the monarch&rsquo;s life cycle. The next phase was a mural painted on the exterior walls of The Monarch, a new event space in downtown Ogden. For the third phase, Kim and her team selected three student interns from the Lindquist College of Arts &amp; Humanities to help produce a monochrome mural for the Kimball Visual Arts Center atrium.</p>
                <p>Kim hopes the Ogden murals will create awareness about the monarch&rsquo;s endangered status and inspire widespread conservationism.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Introduced in 1975, Weber State's emergency healthcare department is one of the oldest of its type
                    in the country. Consequently, it's not uncommon for department chair <strong>William
                        "Bill" Robertson</strong> to run into alumni. However, even he was surprised by a
                    recent connection.</p>
                <p>Robertson was hired to accredit a bachelor&rsquo;s program in emergency medical care in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). At the bottom of a lengthy resume, <strong>Eddie Callachan</strong>, the program director, listed Weber State for his first course as an emergency medical technician. Callachan, who is from South Africa, took an exploratory course at WSU while visiting family in Utah in 1993. &ldquo;It kind of gives you goose bumps to think the things he&rsquo;s doing on the other side of the world started here in this department,&rdquo; Robertson said.</p>
                <p>Callachan earned his Ph.D. in emergency care from the University of Cape Town, and served as chief flight paramedic for critical care transport in the UAE medical services corps.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never forgotten my time at WSU,&rdquo; Callachan wrote.&nbsp;&ldquo;I bet the program must be incredible now.&rdquo;</p>

            <div>
                <p>After a successful regular season &mdash; the Wildcats won the Big Sky Conference regular-season softball crown for the fourth straight year &mdash; and a dominating win in the 2019 Big Sky Conference championship game, defeating Northern Colorado 8&ndash;0, the Wildcats earned a trip to the NCAA Tournament in Los Angeles. There, they picked up a 7&ndash;3 win over Cal State Fullerton and became the first team in school and conference history to win an NCAA regional game. The season later ended at the hands of the University of Missouri.</p>
                <p>2019 also saw the Wildcats, led by league MVP <strong>Takesha Saltern</strong>, set a Big Sky win-percentage record with a 14&ndash;2 mark in conference play.</p>

                <p>Weber State women&rsquo;s soccer had an incredible turnaround in 2018, earning the Big Sky Conference regular-season championship after a 10th-place finish in 2017, the biggest statistical improvement in conference history. The Wildcats piled up a school-record seven league wins (7&ndash;1&ndash;1 Big Sky, 9&ndash;4&ndash;4 overall) on their way to their first regular-season title since 2008 and their first title of any kind since 2013. With the help of nine All-Big Sky selections, head coach <strong>Tim Crompton</strong> bagged his third Big Sky Coach of the Year honor.</p>

He told students that jazz music tells America&rsquo;s story and can help us all become better human beings. Other Browning Presents! events during the 2018&ndash;19 academic year included a conversation with Pulitzer Prize winner Ronan Farrow and a performance by the Choir of Clare College, Cambridge.</p>

                    <p>Weber State football built on its successful 2017 campaign, repeating as Big Sky Conference champions in 2018 en route to another FCS quarterfinals appearance. The Wildcats finished the season ranked No. 6 in the country in the STATS FCS poll, winning 10 or more games in back-to-back years for the first time in school history. WSU entered the playoffs as the No. 2 overall seed, also a program best.</p>
                    <p>Individually, the Wildcats had a school record 13 players named to the Big Sky All-Conference first team, seven of whom also earned All-America honors. Leading the way was freshman running back <strong>Josh Davis</strong>, who set a WSU freshman record with 1,362 rushing yards and 10 total touchdowns. His efforts earned him the Jerry Rice Award as the National Freshman of the Year. He was also named Utah Male Collegiate Athlete of the Year at Utah Gov. Gary Herbert&rsquo;s State of Sports Awards. As the Wildcats attempt a three-peat in 2019, they will do so with a new look to their home field. In September, Weber State broke ground on a 27,000-square-foot athletics complex in Stewart Stadium&rsquo;s north end zone. The new building will include the Barbara and Rory Youngberg Football Center, the Sark&rsquo;s Boys Gateway, the Stromberg Strength and Conditioning Complex, the Marquardt-Kimball Plaza and the Behnken Plaza. The project opened in advance of the 2019 home-opener.</p>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>Fifteen WSU management information systems (MIS) scholars are heading to Carnegie Mellon University&rsquo;s Heinz College, home to the nation&rsquo;s No. 1 graduate school for information technology and management.* Nine will be starting their master&rsquo;s degrees at Carnegie Mellon in the fall of 2019; six attended a cybersecurity fellowship at the university over the summer.</p>
                <p>Recognizing the need for highly skilled cybersecurity and information systems professionals, WSU associate professor<br />
                    of MIS <strong>Randy Boyle</strong> collaborated with industry leaders to develop an innovative formula of curriculum and instruction to meet industry demand, and prepare students for advanced degrees.</p>
                <p>Boyle&rsquo;s students have been successfully competing for placements in the CMU summer fellowship for several years. In 2019, he spearheaded a partnership where his students compete for limited spots in CMU&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s programs.</p>
                <p>Randy Trzeciak, a director at CMU, has been impressed by WSU students. &ldquo;Weber State students have unique skills that are indicators of success in a master&rsquo;s program,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In addition to tech skills, they have solid business and critical-thinking skills.&rdquo;</p>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>With warm colors and a flood of natural light, WSU&rsquo;s new Community Education Center provides a welcoming atmosphere for those seeking pathways to a degree or career. Located in central Ogden, the center helps WSU further integrate into the community by offering residents courses in English as a second language, basic computer skills and job-search skills, and helping future students navigate college registration and financial-aid applications.</p>
                <p>The center also houses a Melba S. Lehner Children&rsquo;s School extension, the Ogden Civic Action Network and the Center for Community Engaged Learning Community Partnerships Extension.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;The Community Education Center reaches out and helps those who may not think furthering their education is attainable,&rdquo; said <strong>Brian Stecklein</strong>, associate dean of the Division of Online &amp; Continuing Education. &ldquo;It is a place where people can come and prepare for the next steps in their educational process.&rdquo;</p>

            <div class="regular-article__body">
                <p>It was a golden year for two groups designed to empower underrepresented populations at Weber State.</p>
                <p>The Black Scholars United club, which celebrated its 50th anniversary throughout the 2018&ndash;19 academic year, promotes leadership, higher learning and education for black students, along with hosting community service projects and activities.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Black Scholars United is more than a club; it&rsquo;s a community,&rdquo; said <strong>JaLisa Lee</strong>, 2018&ndash;19 club president. &ldquo;We promote unity among black students through cultural understanding, academic excellence, community involvement, student engagement and leadership.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>During its 50th anniversary, the American Indian Council (AIC) hosted its inaugural Native American College Prep and Scholarship Night at Weber State University Davis in October. Partnering with local school districts, the event encouraged Native American high school students to consider post-secondary education.</p>
                <p>Providing Native American students with connections and a sense of community is the primary focus of the AIC, says advisor <strong>Tashina Barber BA/BA &rsquo;14</strong>. She first discovered the value of the council while serving as a student member of the group in 2012.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Being part of AIC provides a sense of belonging and it instills confidence,&rdquo; Barber said. &ldquo;It helped me connect with other groups on campus and prepared me to further my education in graduate school.&rdquo;</p>
