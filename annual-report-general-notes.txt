These files were duplicated from the template site in AnnualReport

The "global" build has been fully tested and passes.

The current structure uses a separate style sheet for custom fonts and js to delay visibility until font has loaded.
This method was chosen after extensive testing of custom font loading techniques although it was not that much more efficient than other methods.

There will be additional local css for the home page, which gets a custom design on the Featured Articles section each year. Everything else should be able to be built to native styles.

See annual-report-workflow.txt for flow charts of the build process for global (annual report), project (custom type) and page (subpage, background colors and images) level build processes.

Also see the gdoc Merge annual report 2020 into main template to read other possible additions from the 2020 production version to some version of a template. This 2020 template could be merged with further advancements from the 2020 production version to create a new overall template version.
